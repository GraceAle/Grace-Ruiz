          <p>The <i>iPhone</i> was the first phone create by apple. The <i>iPhone</i> was released June 24, 2007. It started at $499 for just 4GB. Back then 4GB seemed a lot because not many apps were existed and not much but just texting and taking photos was a thing back then. It was a very small device and to be fair it was fairly decent in 2007. It offered a 3.7-in screen with a 2 mega-pixel camera. Many people were worried the <i>iPhone</i> wouldn’t sell because of its price. But with little time sells grew rapidly. The <i>iPhone</i> laid the foundation for the modern smartphone. It allowed great access to the world’s information. Many were fascinated on how the device was touch screen. The Apple store also made a big difference. Many people were granted access to many amazing apps at the time that helped people of that time. Of course, today we would have thought that was so little.</p>

          <p>Apple came out with a new design for the <i>iPhone 7</i> in 2016. The iphone 8 was the first iphone to have a glass back when normally they were made out of aluminum. the biggest problem with a glass back people had was that it was easily breakable. It also made the phone heavier and easier to drop. Replacing the glass on the back could be as expensive as buying a new phone. The camera quality was improved by adding a 12-mega pixel. A big change in this iphone was the home button. The home button was changed into a haptic-based virtual button. The audio jack was also removed, so any old headphones wouldn’t work unless an adapter were to be connected to the headphones. Quickly after announcing the Iphone 8 it was released Sept. 22 starting at $699.</p>

Its GB’s also increased and its highest was 256 but it came with a greater cost. Animoji was also a new thing that came with the new ios.
